2. OVERVIEW
============

This README explains the Video Library TRD package and provides 
information minimum requirement and hardware setup.

The TRD is an embedded video processing application designed to showcase 
various features and capabilities of Zynq Z-7020 All Programmable SoC (AP SoC) 
device for the embedded domain. The TRD consists of two elements: The 
Zynq-7000 AP SoC Processing System (PS) and a video processing pipeline 
implemented in Programmable Logic (PL). The AP SoC allows the user to implement 
an video processing algorithm that performs edge detection on an image (Sobel 
filter) either as a software program running on the Zynq-7000 AP SoC PS or as 
a hardware accelerator inside the PL.  

The TRD demonstrates how the user can accelerate an OpenCV application with 
Video Library and seamlessly switch between a software or a hardware 
implementation and evaluate the cost and benefit of each implementation. 

For more information, please refer XAPP1167 (version 1.0).


3. SOFTWARE TOOLS AND HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS
============================================

Software:
  -- ISE Design Suite Embedded Edition, version 14.6 (2013.2)
  -- Proper installation of required license files for the TRD.
  -- Optional: ZC702 board uses CP210x USB to UART Bridge to provide COM port
     connection to the board. This configuration is highly recommended because
     the UART outputs information to hyper terminal right after power up.
     To use this feature, hyper terminal, Minicom, teraterm or equivalent
     terminal software on the host machine is required. For details, please
     refer to UG926 for USB-to-UART Bridge driver installation.
  -- For additional information on software installation, refer to UG798 (v14.6)

Hardware:
  -- The reference design targets the Zynq ZC702 evaluation board, Rev C or
     above.
  -- ZC702 evaluation board setup in the default configuration as documented
     in the Default Switch and Jumper Setting of UG850.
  -- AC power adapter (12VDC)
  -- HDMI-to-HDMI or HDMI-to-DVI cable (depending on available Monitor)
  -- Monitor capable of supporting 1080p60
  -- USB Type-A Female to USB Micro-B Male cable
  -- USB hub
  -- USB mouse
  -- USB keyboard
  -- Optional: USB Type A Male to USB Mini-B Male cable if using USB-to-UART
     bridge
  -- Optional: Avnet FMC IMAGEON daughter card for video input with 
     1080p / 720p input video source
  -- SD memory card reader for transferring files onto the SD card.
     (not included in the package)

5. INSTALLATION AND OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS 
===========================================

ZC702 Initial Setup:
--------------------

-- All jumpers and switches should be in default setting except SW16.
   Mode switch SW16 should be set to boot from SD card.
   See image for SD boot in Getting Started Guide (UG926).
   For a board with SW16, use the following configuration
   1: GND
   2: GND
   3: VCC
   4: VCC
   5: GND
   J21, J20, J22, J25, J26: Unstuffed
   For Rev C version of the board which does not have SW16,
   use the following jumper settings:
   J21: 2-3
   J20: 2-3
   J22: 1-2
   J25: 1-2
   J26: 2-3
-- Connect one end of the HDMI cable to board HDMI connector, connect the other
   end to the monitor's HDMI or DVI input
-- Connect USB Mini-B side of USB-to-Mini-B cable to the on-board mini USB 
   connector (J17). Connect USB side to the control PC to enable USB-to-UART 
   bridge.
-- Connect the AC power adapter
-- Connect USB Micro-B cable to on-board USB Micro connector J1, then connect 
   up USB hub, mouse and keyboard.
-- Optional: If Avnet Imageon card is used, connect the card to FMC slot 2.
   Connect 1080p video input source to HDMI-IN.

Building Design:
----------------

To enable easily building the reference designs, a Makefile is also provided 
with the following targets:
   'make elf'       -- build sw (video_library_cmd)
   'make sim'       -- build and run csim test
   'make core'      -- synthesis and export pcore
   'make bitstream' -- generate bistream (system.bit)
   'make boot'      -- generate boot image (BOOT.bin)
   'make all'       -- build sw and hw, generate sd_image

Running 'make all' from the Linux command line or the Vivado HLS Command Prompt 
under Windows that launched by provided batch file rebuilds the entire design 
and generates an SD card image that can be run. Detailed instructions to Build 
Hardware and Software for this TRD are provided in XAPP1167.

The pre compiled files in sd_image directory can be loaded on SD card root
to get started with the design. Here various options can be explored.
