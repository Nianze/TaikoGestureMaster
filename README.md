Cornell ECE5775 Final Project: Taiko Master game based on gesture recognition

Taiko Master (太鼓の達人) is a very popular rhythm game. In this game, players simulate playing a Taiko drum in time with music. This project aims to implement the game on the base of a zedboard and a camera that records human gestures.
The high­level idea is to use the FPGA analysis human hand gesture in real time and use this recognized gesture to simulate a hit on the drum on a certain beat. We assume to use three different human gestures, each corresponding to the gestures we normally use in rock­paper­scissors game.
